                <h3>who is Satoshi Nakamoto ?</h3>
                <p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the presumed pseudonymous
                    person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper,
                    and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation.
                    As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database.
                    Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin until December 2010.

                    There has been widespread speculation about Nakamoto's true identity,
                    with various people posited as the person or persons behind the name.
                    Though Nakamoto's name is Japanese, and inscribed as a man living in Japan,
                    most of the speculation has involved software and cryptography experts in the United States or Europe.

                <h3>Characteristics and identity</h3>
                <p>Nakamoto has never revealed personal information when discussing technical matters,
                    but has at times commented on banking and fractional-reserve banking.
                    Some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English.

                    On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old man who lived in Japan;
                    he cited his date of birth as 5 April 1975.
                    Some theorize that the date referenced the signing of Executive Order 6102,
                    which prohibited the ownership of gold coins in the United States, and 1975 as the year it was repealed.
                    Author Dominic Frisby categorized the date as an "obscure but brilliant reference" 
                    and as "extremely political".
                    
                    Some have considered that Nakamoto might be a team of people.
                    Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who read bitcoin's code,
                    said that Nakamoto was either a "team of people" or a "genius"; Laszlo Hanyecz,
                    a developer who had emailed Nakamoto, had the feeling the code was too well-designed for one person;
                    Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: "He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky."
                    
                    The use of British English in both source code comments and forum postings,
                    such as the expression "bloody hard", terms such as "flat" and "maths",
                    and the spellings "grey" and "colour",
                    led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one person in a consortium claiming to be him,
                    was of Commonwealth origin.
                    The reference to London's Times newspaper in the first bitcoin block suggested to some
                    a particular interest in the British government.
                    
                    Stefan Thomas, a Swiss software engineer and active community member,
                    graphed the timestamps of each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500);
                    the chart showed a steep decline to almost none between 5 a.m. and 11 a.m.
                    Greenwich Mean Time (midnight to 6 a.m. Eastern Standard Time). This was between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. 
                    Japan Standard Time, suggesting an unusual sleep pattern for someone living in Japan.
                    As this pattern held even on Saturdays and Sundays,
                    it suggested that Nakamoto was consistently asleep at this time.</p>

                <h3>Development of bitcoin</h3>
                <p>Nakamoto said that the work of writing bitcoin's code began in the second quarter of 2007.
                    On 18 August 2008, he or a colleague registered the domain name bitcoin.org,
                    and created a web site at that address. On 31 October,
                    Nakamoto published a white paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com
                    describing a digital cryptocurrency, titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".

                    On 9 January 2009,
                    Nakamoto released version 0.1 of the bitcoin software on SourceForge and launched the network
                    by defining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.
                    Penenberg, Adam. "The Bitcoin Crypto-Currency Mystery Reopened". Fast Company.
                    Archived from the original on 6 October 2013.
                    A New Yorker writer implies he found Bitcoin's mysterious creator. 
                    We think he got the wrong man, 
                    and offer far more compelling evidence that points to someone else entirely.
                    Embedded in the coinbase transaction of this block is the text: 
                    "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks", 
                    citing a headline in the UK newspaper The Times published on that date. 
                    This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp and a derisive comment on 
                    the alleged instability caused by fractional-reserve banking.
                    
                    Nakamoto continued to collaborate with other developers on bitcoin's software until mid-2010, 
                    making all modifications to the source code himself. 
                    He then gave control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen, 
                    and transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community.
                    
                    As of 2021, Nakamoto is estimated to own between 750,000 and 1,100,000 bitcoin. 
                    In November 2021, when bitcoin reached a value of over $68,000, 
                    his net worth would have been up to $73 billion, 
                    making him the 15th-richest person in the world at the time.</p>
